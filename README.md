## Setting Up & Running Challenges

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure you have Python and pip installed.
    - The `venv` module may not offer all features on every platform. If you encounter problems, consider using `virtualenv`.

2. **Setting Up a Virtual Environment**:
    - Choose a directory for the virtual environment.
    - Create the environment:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
      ```
    - Example: To set up a virtual environment in a "venv" directory:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```

3. **Activating the Virtual Environment**:
    - For Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - For Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
   Once activated, the shell prompt will display the environment's name.

4. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

5. **Installing Packages**:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
